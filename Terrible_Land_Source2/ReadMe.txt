Adventures in Terrible-Land!!!

Thank you for downloading my side-scroller.  I am Patrick Tuckey, and this is my first complete game.

Controls:
Arrows, and Space Bar to throw the candy cane.

There are some known issues with this game:

1) Memory Leaks......yeah, just don't go playing this for more than 20 minutes at a time!

2) Make sure you have your system colour set to 32-bit - otherwise the transparent images won't appear transparent.

3) I take no responsibility for what this game might do to your system - it's free, it's open source, so don't complain if it crashes!
